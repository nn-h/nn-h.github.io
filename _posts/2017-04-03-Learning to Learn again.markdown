It's been too long since I've used this blog to communicate anything.
It's been so long in fact that I have managed to shift my perspective on learning,
as well as what it means to actually learn.
Listening to the Partially Derivative podcast there was mention of of the learning
to Learn course available on Coursera.
With the amount of dense material and broad range that encompasses Machine learning
and Data Science, taking in information and learning properly is very daunting.
With the vocabulary that comes with Data Science there can be times when I am reading
an article or following through a book and retaining that information can prove difficult.
A short distraction or broken focus can make it difficult to jump back into the rhythm of reading
and learning new material.

Since taking the Learning to Learn course, I've learnt some interesting tricks and methods to help
alleviate the distractions that come with long sessions of focus and learning.

**Pomodoro Technique**

Put simply the Pomodoro Technique, is the breakdown of a larger task or work into a set of smaller smaller duration pieces. Recently I've been reading about statistics. I've jumped into [Dataquest.io](http://dataquest.io) and their courses on Data Science. Their introduction to statistics is a good entry point to get the quick gist of the connection between the two fields, stats and data science, however, the depth of the material isn't intended to be a complete learning for the underlying workings and features of data science and stats. Partially Derivative recommended the industry known book *An introduction to Statistical Learning*, a book which delves into the nitty gritty of stats. I employed the Pomodoro Technique to get through the book, breaking my reading sessions into 20 minute blocks, before stopping and taking a breather. I know, 20 minute blocks don't seem like a long time, but I've never been the best mathematician and understanding and re-reading some of the concepts is something I require to get the material into my head, even reiterating over the same block and skimming over the key concepts to remind myself about the intention of the material and the pieces to take away. Highlighting minimally, noting notable words to take away and make connections to the concepts and the keywords involved helps reinforce the material through chunking material into smaller pieces.

**Flash Cards**

I know it seems pre-school but I didn't think I'd find myself using flash cards.
[Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is a piece of software that allows you to make flash cards for whatever you want, out of almost any kind of information. Flashcards are a great tool in learning, helping to facilitate memory recall, an important step in solidifying memory or information into long term memory.
