title: Starting Point
---

Much like the rest of the development community, I am partaking in my own small
journey to write my own gitpage so that I might keep better track of my work,
as well as solutions to problems I encounter while working in my own environment.
My goals I'd like to achieve with this tool are as follows:

1. Keep a journal of my work, more specifically the projects I open up on github.

2. Gain personal development with regard to developing and journaling ideas, and
work.

3. Blog about my other interests, write some reviews for the things I've read and critique
other articles that interest me.
